# Fleet Management System – Systems Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is based on a university systems analysis and modelling case study focused on analysing and proposing a fleet management system for a logistics company.

## Objective
To identify operational problems in an existing fleet management process and design a high-level system that improves efficiency, real-time visibility, and decision-making.

## Scope of Analysis
- Problem definition and system vision
- Stakeholder identification and classification
- Business and ICT system boundaries
- High-level system capabilities and constraints
- Event analysis and system interactions

## Methodology
The project applies systems analysis techniques such as stakeholder analysis, boundary identification, event tables, and requirement definition to model a real-world business system.

## Documentation
A detailed system analysis summary is available in the documentation folder.

## Data & Confidentiality
This project is based on a fictionalised case study used for academic purposes. No real company data, personal information, or confidential systems are included.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Systems analysis and modelling
- Business process analysis
- Stakeholder analysis
- Requirements gathering

## Fleet Management System Design

This document presents a high-level system design for a proposed
fleet management system for a logistics company.

The design focuses on improving operational efficiency, real-time
visibility, and decision-making through structured systems analysis
and modelling techniques.

### Contents of the Design
- System assumptions and scope
- Context diagram and system boundaries
- Data flow diagram (DFD)
- Data dictionary
- Process specification
- Use case diagram and use case description

## Detailed System Modelling & Behaviour Design

This document extends the high-level system design by describing
the internal structure and dynamic behaviour of the fleet management
system using UML-based modelling techniques.

The focus is on how the system behaves across key operational
scenarios, how components interact, and how complex workflows
are managed in practice.

### What This Design Covers
- Key system assumptions used to support modelling decisions
- Class diagram describing core system entities and relationships
- Activity diagram modelling the end-to-end delivery booking process
- State machine diagram capturing the lifecycle of ongoing support and service
- Sequence diagram detailing real-time tracking and monitoring interactions

The diagrams collectively demonstrate how the system coordinates
between customers, dispatchers, drivers, vehicles, and supporting
services to enable efficient logistics operations and real-time visibility.
