# Fleet Management System – Systems Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is based on a university systems analysis and modelling case study focused on analysing and proposing a fleet management system for a logistics company.

## Objective
To identify operational problems in an existing fleet management process and design a high-level system that improves efficiency, real-time visibility, and decision-making.

## Scope of Analysis
- Problem definition and system vision
- Stakeholder identification and classification
- Business and ICT system boundaries
- High-level system capabilities and constraints
- Event analysis and system interactions

## Methodology
The project applies systems analysis techniques such as stakeholder analysis, boundary identification, event tables, and requirement definition to model a real-world business system.

## Documentation
A detailed system analysis summary is available in the documentation folder.

## Data & Confidentiality
This project is based on a fictionalised case study used for academic purposes. No real company data, personal information, or confidential systems are included.

## Fleet Management System Design

This document presents a high-level system design for a proposed
fleet management system for a logistics company.

The design focuses on improving operational efficiency, real-time
visibility, and decision-making through structured systems analysis
and modelling techniques.
